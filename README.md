# Different Ways We Used useRef in this Project

1. We Explored useRef, Learned how to use useRef to directly access input field values without triggering re-renders.

2. We Explored ref persistence, Learned how to use refs to manage timers across multiple component instances, avoiding the pitfalls of using variables. This ensures clean, efficient state management for side effects.
