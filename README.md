# Different Ways We Used useRef in this Project

1. We Explored useRef, Learned how to use useRef to directly access input field values without triggering re-renders.

2. We Explored ref persistence, we Learned how to use refs to manage timers across multiple component instances, avoiding the pitfalls of using variables. This ensures clean, efficient state management for side effects.

3. We Explored forwadedRef, we Learned how to use forwardRef to pass refs between components, enabling direct DOM manipulation and advanced component interactions.
